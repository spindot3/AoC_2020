## Day Zero Template
In the folder day00 there is a template which can be used as a starting point for each day.
The idea is to have everything wihtin one file in order to adjust it to the needs of the according puzzle of that day.

## Data Folder
Under the folder of each day, there is a data folder which can contain two files:
- data.txt
- sample.txt

data.txt is for the real input and sample.txt is for the sample input data of that day.
The data folder, the data.txt and the sample.txt are all named the same for each day, but are placed under the folder of the according day.
The data folder, the data.txt and the sampole.txt contain no day number. The idea here is to make it most unlikely that you work with the input data of another day.
